# Chris's Dotfiles

Dotfiles I use on my Mac system and the installation process for Mac OSX.

Installation Pre-Requisites (ensure these are present on your system before installation)
- Brew
- Install SPF-13 VIM
    - curl https://j.mp/spf13-vim3 -L > spf13-vim.sh && sh spf13-vim.sh

Then execute from within the cloned folder

```
./install.sh
```

It will: 
- install all items in the **Brewfile**
- configure the **SPF13-vim** overrides
